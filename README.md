# springboot-onelogin-sso
This demo application intended to use **spring-security-saml2-core** and **spring-security-saml-dsl-core** artifacts to demostrate the Single sign-on with SAML. You can use any IDP like ADFS, Okta, Shibboleth, OpenAM, OneLogin and others. 
In this demo I am using OneLogin IDP. Go through [blog](http://www.techsams.com/java/spring/sso/onelogin/single-sign-on-with-spring-saml.html) for more details.
